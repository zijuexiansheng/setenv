# setenv
A `.bashrc`-like way to set your environment variables.

# Usage
* Copy the two `.cmd` files in `./src` into `%USERPROFILE%\setenv`. You can run the command `echo %USERPROFILE%` to see what `%USERPROFILE%` is.
* Run `loonenv.reg.cmd` as Administrator.
* Edit `loonenv.cmd` as you wish. The `loonenv.cmd` in this repo is an example in my laptop
